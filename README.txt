This is the August 12, 2009 Adafruit Motor shield firmware with basic Microstepping support. Works with all Arduinos and the Mega

Updated in September 2012 for use on PIC32 architecture (chipKIT/MPIDE)

Updated in June 2016 so that if the board isn't a supported architecture, the
library will still compile and at least use analogWrite with whatever default
PWM frequency is used.
